title: "Physiological Arousal as a Predominant Source of Individual Differences in Functional Brain Networks"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/6-ur-natneur
excerpt: 'Sources of individual variability in functional brain network properties are poorly understood, yet such individual differences are promising targets for fMRI-based biomarkers in precision psychiatry. Using the systemic low frequency oscillations (sLFO), we assess arousal x functional network relationships on large-scale and identify sLFO-assessed arousal as a predominant source of individual differences in brain function.'
