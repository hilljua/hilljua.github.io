A recent survey of US trafficking survivors found that 90.8% had been arrested. This often occurs as a direct result of trafficking and is a recognized issue in the legal space. However, discussions surrounding this pervasive issue often fail to address a core components of the injustice: it's impact on health and wellbeing. Here, we break the sex trafficking experience down into six stages: recruitment, exploitation, detention, exit of trafficking, and risk for re-trafficking. We assess the impact of criminalization on wellbeing at each stage to comprehensively understand the tangible health implications of this issue.
