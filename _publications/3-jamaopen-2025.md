In this cohort study of children, a whole-brain functional connectivity score derived from neuroimaging data modified the association between ACEs and psychiatric disorders. This modification was particularly seen against threat-related ACEs and was pronounced for female youths. These findings suggest that functional connectivity strength in a broad system relevant to cognitive control may protect preadolescents who have experienced lifetime ACEs—especially girls and those experiencing threat-related ACEs—from developing transdiagnostic psychopathology.
