Here, use pharmacological manipulation and two unique fMRI techniques to assess the brain: temporal dynamic engagement of cognitive networks & comprehensive profiles of cortical-striatal connectivity. 

We found that methylphenidate (a catecholamine agonist) increases time spent in the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN). This fits with methylphenidate's role in attention, as the DMN is involved in internal attention while the DAN is involved in externally focused attention. Methylphenidate specifically increases transitions into these brain network states, suggesting that *even at rest* methylphenidate primes the brain to engage in attentional states. 

Methylphenidate also specifically altered the *relative* connectivity strength between multiple cortical regions and the striatum - in other words, shifting the rank of which cortical-striatal connections are strongest or weakest. This likely represents a shift in the priority of cortical-striatal communications. 

Finally, (and critically!) we show that methylphenidate's impact on cortical-striatal communication and on the temporal dynamics of functional brain networks is linked. Greater magnitude of change in relative connectivity strength between cortical regions and the dorsal caudate under methylphenidate is tightly correlated to spending more time in the default mode network under the drug.
