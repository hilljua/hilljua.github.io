title: "From Rest to Focus: Pharmacological Modulation of the Relationship between Resting State Dynamics and Task-based Brain Activation"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/4-ur-npp-2025
excerpt: 'This work highlights the potential that resting-state dynamics hold in predicting drug responses. We show that resting-state dynamics at baseline are differentially related to brain activation during a cognitive task based on drug condition.'
