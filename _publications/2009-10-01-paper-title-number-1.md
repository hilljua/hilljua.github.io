excerpt: 'Methylphenidate increased the amount of time spent in, and transitions to, network states involved in both external and internal attention — specifically the dorsal attention network state and default mode network state — suggesting that even at rest, methylphenidate may prime the brain to engage in both external or internal attentional states. Methylphenidate‐induced enhancement of time spent in the default mode network state was coupled to methylphenidate's rearrangement of striatal connectivity profiles with cortex.'
