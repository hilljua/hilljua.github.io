title: "Systemic Physiological “Noise” in fMRI has Clinical Relevance"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/5-ur-bpgos
excerpt: 'Systemic low frequency oscillations (sLFO) in fMRI data are distinct from the more focal neuronal activation we traditionally study in neuroimaging. Because of this, the field often (dis)regards the sLFO as "noise". However, here we show that the sLFO itself holds clinical relevance: it is related to craving, dependence, pharmacological state, and clinical state (abstinence vs. satiety).'
