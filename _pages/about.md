Welcome to the site. I am a postbaccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and an aspiring MD-PhD, applying in the 2026 application cycle.


My interest centers around investigating the neurobiological correlates of transdiagnostic sympotomology in psychiatric and neurological disorders. The ultimate aim of this work is to improve our understanding of psychopathology and individualized treatment approaches, including for patients with co-occuring disorders. In addition to my love for working in the clinic with research participants, I enjoy employing novel methods in functional MRI to improve our understanding of such neurobiology. I hope to continue training in rigorous and creative computational research methods in my next steps.
