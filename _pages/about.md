My interest centers around investigating the neurobiological correlates of transdiagnostic sympotomology. The ulitmate aim of such work is to improve our understanding of psychopathology and individualized treatment approaches, including for patients with co-occuring disorders. In addition to my love for working in the clinic with research participants, I enjoy employing novel methods in functional MRI to improve our understanding of such neurobiology. I hope to continue training in rigorous and creative computational research methods.
